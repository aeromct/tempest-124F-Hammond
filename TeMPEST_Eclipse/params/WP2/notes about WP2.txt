I have some variales for temperature, but need to contact the author to see how to use them.

Options in Tempest Simulation for the tether properties 
 T_COND_RADIUS   = Radius of conductor in/of tether (m)                        
 T_RESISTIVITY   = Resistivity of tether material (ohm-cm) at given temperature
 T_RESIST_TEMP   = Temperature at which resisitivity is specified (deg C)      
 T_RES_TEMPCO    = Temperature resistance coefficient of tether (per deg C)    
 B_EMISSIVITY    = Infrared emissivity of bare tether segment                  
 B_ABSORBTIVITY  = Solar absorbtivity of bare tether segment 

Output Options
 T_TEMPERATURE   = Tether temperature (deg C)
 T_RESISTANCE    = Tether resistance (ohms)
