Using the library:
------------------

An application that uses any of the routines and constants defined in
the orbit library must include the proper function declarations and
type definitions defined in "orbit.h".  This file, in turn, assumes
that it has access to some items defined in other files. It follows
that the lines

#include <math.h>
#include "advmath.h"
#include "earth.h"
#include "orbit.h"

must appear before any function in the library is called.

The compiled application should link with the orbit library
(containing the implementation of the functions described above), as
well as some other libraries. It suffices to link with "-lorbit
-learth -lam -lm" as linker options.
